# SMS-Sender
A BulkGate API-powered SMS notifications program

Sends an SMS to the supplied number(s)
This is mainly a personal project so I can easily implement SMS 
notifications in my future projects.


You will need to configure the program by entering your bulkgate.com 
API key and wallet id into the .env dotfile

To configure correctly, ensure you have a .env in the
/src directory with the following variables

APP_ID = Application ID
API_KEY = Application Token
WALLET = Wallet to charge
